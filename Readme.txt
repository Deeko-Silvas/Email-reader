Email reader to extract certain information from a folder of emails and import into a csv file to allow easy importing into CRM software.

** Will only work with specific inputs and email layout

Instructions

GDPR.exe and the GDPR_opt_ins folder must be located within the same folder.

1. Copy emails from Outlook to the GDPR_opt_ins folder (as many as you want)
2. run GDPR.exe
3. Console window will appear and tell you how many have completed and how many have failed. Press enter to close.
4. The program will create a GDPR_opt_ins.csv file which will contain all of the data, this can be opened in Excel. If you need to save as an .xls or .xlsx file for importing you can save as and change the file type.
5. The program will delete any emails from the GDPR_opt_ins folder that have been imported into the csv file. Any others will be left in the file to enter manually. No emails will be deleted from Outlook.

Notes
If the GDPR_opt_ins.csv file already exists then it must be closed before running the program. 
When you re-run the program it will clear the contents of the csv file so if you need to keep the data it will need to be renamed or moved to another folder.
